# We worked for the following specifications:

1) Assessment shall be of MCQ pattern

2) There must be a question pool for the assessment: We used a quiz.js file containing questions, options and the correct answer.

3) The questions displayed in the assessment shall be only from that pool

4) Number of questions in the pool shall be more than questions displayed

5) Set a time limit for the assessment: Test gets auto submitted after the given time ends.

6) Question order shall be shuffled for each candidate appearing: Questions get shuffled after we restart the application.

7) Assessment score shall be generated at the time of submission
